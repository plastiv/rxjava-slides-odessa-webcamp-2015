                <h2>Motivation</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Modern applications are inherently concurrent.</li>
                    <li class="fragment">Writing concurrent programs that are correct is difficult.</li>
                </ul>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Asynchronous and reactive methodologies allow you to better utilize system resources. Instead of wasting a thread waiting for network (or disk) IO, it can be fully utilized to perform other work instead.</p>
                    <p>A broad range of technologies exists to facilitate this style of programming, ranging from the very limited and not really usable java.util.concurrent.Future, to full blown libraries and runtimes like Akka (and everything in between).</p>
                    <p>one library stood out: RxJava. It has a very rich set to compose asynchronous workflows, has no dependencies on its own and is used at high-profile companies like Netflix. The Rx model (more on that a little later) is mature and well-thought and the community is vibrant.</p>
                    <p>We hope that once you read through the introduction and get more familiar with the concept, you never want to go back. We certainly don't.</p>

                <p>Before jumping into the details, one thing warrants clarification: RxJava, and therefore the Java SDK fully supports Java 8. This brings some great improvements, most prominently support for lambdas and method references.</p>
                <p>Because the Java SDK has support for Java 6 and 7, most of the examples shown in the documentation use anonymous classes instead of lambdas. You are free and even encouraged to use them if you are able to, but Java 8 on production servers is still a few months/years away at most companies.</p>
                <p>That said, we expect the SDK to be around for a long time and want to pave the way for the future right now. To whet your appetite, compare Java 6 code to Java 8 (same code):</p>
                <p>Also, RxJava has support for other languages like Scala, Groovy or Clojure. If you are using one of those languages, please refer to the RxJava documentation on how to use the adapters.</p>

                <p>You can think of a Observable as the push-based, asynchronous cousin (&quot;dual&quot;) of the pull-based, synchronous Iterable. The contract of a Observable is that zero to N data events can happen, followed by a complete event. In addition, an error event can happen at any time, also completing the Observable.</p>
                <p>A Observable can also be converted into a BlockingObservable, which then, unsurprisingly, behaves very much like a Iterable.</p>
                <p>The key element to take away is that a Observable&lt;T&gt; can emit 0 to N events, which is very different of a Future&lt;T&gt;, which only contains one value. Once you start to work on streams instead of single values, you will very much appreciate this fact.</p>

                    <p>by definition, a Observable does not imply that the underlying code is executed asynchronously. As a consumer of an Observable, you leave the actual implementation to the supplier, who is able to change it later on without you having to adapt your code. Imagine, you are consuming this API:</p>
                    <p>It could be that when load() is called, the String value is fetched right out of a Map in memory (or even a hard-coded value). In this case, there is no need to move the execution away from the caller thread, because the value will be returned instantaneously. If at a later point the implementation needs to be changed so that the String is loaded through a web service (which introduces latency and other semantics), the API doesn't need to be changed, because the underlying implementation is free to move it to a Scheduler.</p>

                <p>You can see that our Observer gets notified of every event and also receives the completed event.</p>
                <p>A well-formed Observable will invoke its Subscriber’s onNext method zero or more times, and then will invoke either the onCompleted or onError method exactly once.</p>

Unless you are implementing a custom Observer, always use Subscriber (because otherwise it will be wrapped in one internally anyway and you are saving unnecessary object allocations).</p>

                <p>You do not need to implement the full Subscriber every time. If you are only interested in the data events, you can subscribe like this:</p>
                <p>Be aware though that if an error happens, the following exception will be propagated:</p>
                <p>It is recommended to always implement an error handler right from the beginning, since things can and will go wrong at some point. It can come in handy though if you just want to try things out quickly or for illustrative purposes.</p>

                    <p>One common mistake is to use Thread.sleep() instead of a latch to synchronize the execution between threads. This is a bad idea because it not really synchronizes anything, but just keeps one thread alive for a specific amount of time. If the actual calls take less time you are wasting time, and if it takes longer you won't get the desired effect. If you do this in unit tests, be prepared for a good amount of non-determinism and randomly failing tests. Always use a CountDownLatch.</p>

                    <p>A technique unique to Observables is to convert it into a BlockingObservable to achieve the same effect. In simple terms, it converts a Observable into a Iterable and making it execute on the caller thread, blocking it until one or more values arrive. This technique is used extensively in the documentation to show concepts, while not having to deal with CountDownLatches all the time. It can also be used if you for some reason are not able to use asynchronous computations.</p>
                    <p>The conversion itself doesn't do any blocking in the first place, only subsequent calls will:</p>

                    <p>There are many ways to create Observables, and you've already seen just() and interval(). There are many more of those convenience methods available on the Observable class, but they all boil down to the create() method. You can simulate the example from before with this:</p>
                    <p>Every time a Subscriber subscribes, the call() method is executed. You can then call onNext, onComplete and onError as you wish, but keep in mind that both onComplete and onError should only be called once, and afterwards no subsequent onNext is allowed to follow so that the contract is met.</p>
                    <p>You can see that no blocking call is needed, because the Observable is completely handled on the current thread. In the section on Schedulers, you learn more about that.</p>
                    <p>This example shows why it is crucial to call subscribe() on the Observable, because only such a call triggers the actual execution of the pipeline. This is a little different with Subjects, which are covered later in this guide. Nevertheless, always call subscribe() on your Observables.</p>
                    <p>Refer to the RxJava documentation on many more methods that you can use to create Observables. If you are dealing with the Java SDK, in most places this is done for you, but there are situation where it comes in handy.</p>

                    <p>Returning a default value is a good idea if you cannot afford to retry or you just don't care (maybe because the flow is not absolutely crucial to your data flow). The following code throws an exception at the first emitted item, but falls back to a default value:</p>
                    <p>Note that you can pass in a function which also takes the Exception, so you can return different values for different exception types or use it for logging purposes.</p>
